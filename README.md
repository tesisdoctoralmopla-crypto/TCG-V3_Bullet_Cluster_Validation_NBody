# TCG-V3 Bullet Cluster Validation: Causal Stability via DBI Lagrangian

This repository contains the results and theoretical analysis for the N-body simulation validating the Constitutive Gravity (TCG) Version 3 model against the Bullet Cluster challenge (1E 0657-56).

## Overview

The TCG V3 model replaces the locally unstable $X^2$ kinetic term with a Born-Infeld (DBI) structure to ensure theoretical consistency while maintaining phenomenological success.

## Key Achievements

1.  **Resolution of the Bullet Cluster:** The simulation reproduces the observed $\sim 2$ Mpc offset between baryonic gas (X-ray emission) and the gravitational potential (lensing signal) without invoking Cold Dark Matter (CDM).
2.  **Causal Stability:** The DBI formulation is mathematically consistent: it is **ghost-free** ($P_{,X} > 0$) and **causally stable** ($c_s^2 \geq 1$) at all scales, resolving the tachyonic instability present in previous TCG versions.
3.  **Phenomenological Equivalence:** The predicted lensing peak position differs by only $2.38\%$ from the original (but unstable) model, confirming that the stability correction preserves the empirical success.

## Simulation Details

* **Code:** Modified GADGET-4 (N-body/SPH)
* **Model:** Constitutive Gravity TCG V3 (DBI Lagrangian)
* **Result:** The observed dissociation is entirely accounted for by the **Constitutive Thrust** mechanism generated by the DBI scalar field.
